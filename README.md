# Nekobox-serve (WIP)
A simple way to handle ytdl requests via rest api.
The functionality is limited and is developed together with the repository nekobox-app.

 ~~Currently unusable.~~
 
 Theoretically you can use it now, at least if you know what to do. I don't recommend it though. Too much unoptimized code, maybe vulnerabilities and a bunch of bugs.
